You are about to witness the very exciting story of a city and its people. It is a story of a city seeking new horizons in a resolute contest with great challenges. That city is Detroit. 1,2,3, now! We're bankrupt. The children's schools suck. There's no work here and all the dudes that are responsible for this probably had steak and Bordeaux for lunch. Welcome to Crime Count, produced with Gimlet media. This season, we're heading to Detroit. This city teach you one thang for sure. You always need a hustle.

Shot me right through the head, it came out right here. It just missed my brain. Cops. Nobody was summarily executed because that's something you couldn't justify. Unsung heroes.

A stripper, who later wound up dead. Quami Kilpatrick. Quami Kilpatrick. Quami. Quami. Quami. I saw people walking around with shirts that said put Quami in jail. You would not have seen a black person with that shirt on. In a city divided by race, things aren't always black and white.
